### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: 2Gi (recommended), 1Gi (minimum)
- **CPU**: 1000m (recommended), 500m (minimum)
- **Storage**: 10Gi for vector database persistence
- **Scaling**: 1-5 instances based on load

## Security Features

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **Non-root Container**: Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Environment Variable Protection**: Sensitive data via environment variables
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models for request validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses without information leakage

### 🔄 Recommended for Production
- **API Authentication**: Implement API key or OAuth authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for production use
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ⚠️ Minor Issues
1. **Negotiation Endpoint Error Handling**: Minor error handling issue in orchestrator
   - **Impact**: Low - doesn't affect core functionality
   - **Workaround**: System continues to function, error is logged
   - **Fix**: Update error handling in orchestrator.py

2. **Model Compatibility**: Some models return compatibility warnings
   - **Impact**: None - system uses fallback models
   - **Status**: Expected behaviour in test environment

### 📋 Future Enhancements
1. **OCR Integration**: Real OCR service for bill image processing
2. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for production data storage
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed success rate tracking
4. **Multi-language Support**: Support for non-English bills
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Native mobile application

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Validate configuration
python deploy.py --validate-only

# Deploy to LangGraph Platform
python deploy.py --name hagglz-production
```

### Local Testing
```bash
